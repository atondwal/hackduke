You're so dumb you think socialism means partying!
You're so dumb you think manual labor is a Mexican!
You're so dumb you think Johnny Cash is a pay toilet!
You're so dumb it takes you an hour and a half to watch "60 Minutes"!
You  so stupid you probably think Taco Bell is where you pay your telephone bill.
You so dumb you got blonde roots in your eyeballs.
You're so stupid, that you got fired from the M & M factory for throwing away all the W's.
You're so stupid, that you went to a Clippers game to get a hair cut.
You're so stupid, that you went to a Whalers game to see Shamu.
You're so stupid, it takes you an hour to cook minute rice.
I'm  looking forward to the pleasure of your company since I haven't had it yet.
When you pass away and people ask me what the cause of your death was, I'll say your stupidity.
You're the best at all you do - and all you do is make people hate you.
Don't you realize that there are enough people to hate in the world already without your working so hard to give us another?
The  thing that terrifies me the most is that someone might hate me as much as I loathe you.
When you get run over by a car it shouldn't be listed under accidents.
All of your ancestors must number in the millions; its hard to believe that many people are to blame for producing you.
Ever since I saw you in your family tree I've wanted to cut it down.
I  hear  that  when  you were a child your mother wanted to hire someone to take care of you but the Mafia wanted too much.
No  one should be punished for accident of birth but you look too much like a wreck not to be.
You  were the answer to a prayer.  Your parents prayed that the world would be made to suffer and here you came along.
You're a habit I'd like to kick; with both feet.
I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside.
I would like the pleasure of your company but it only gives me displeasure.
You've never been outspoken; no one has ever been able to.
At  your speed you'd better not stop your mouth too fast or your teeth will fly through your cranium.
If you ever tax your brain, don't charge more than a penny.
Don't you have a terribly empty feeling ---- in your skull?
You  have  nothing  to fear from my baser instincts; its my finer ones that tell me to kill you.
It's your life --- but I wish you'd let us have it.
I  think you should live for the moment.  But after that I doubt I'll think so.
I  believe in respect for the dead; in fact I could only respect you if you WERE dead.
You have a face only a mother could love - and she hates it!
You never strike out blindly; you fail in the light.
